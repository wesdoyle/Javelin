Ripe dark-skinned berry, forest floor and cooking spice aromas lead the nose along with a whiff of new leather. The chewy palate offers fleshy black cherry, cinnamon, vanilla and a hint of tobacco while polished tannins provide the framework. This is already accessible so no need to cellar it for years. Best through 2021.
