Focused and dense, this intense wine captures the essence of ripe raspberries. Aged in 50% new French oak, it's got a strong vein of coffee and mocha. The flavors broaden out and penetrate, finishing with highlights of cedar, cinnamon and dark chocolate. Drink now through the 2020s, but decant if you want the full expression.
