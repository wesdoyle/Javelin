Coming from a seven-acre vineyard named after the dovecote on the property, this is a magnificent wine. Powered by both fruit tannins and the 28 months of new wood aging, it is darkly rich and with great concentration. As a sign of its pedigree, there is also elegance here, a restraint which is new to this wine. That makes it a wine for long-term aging. Drink from 2022.
