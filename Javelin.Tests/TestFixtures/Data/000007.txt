Lush cedary black-fruit aromas are luxe and offer notes of marzipan and vanilla. This bruiser is massive and tannic on the palate, but still lush and friendly. Chocolate is a key flavor, while baked berry and cassis flavors are hardly wallflowers. On the finish, this is tannic and deep as a sea trench. Drink this saturated black-colored Toro through 2023.
