With its sophisticated mix of mineral, acid and tart fruits, this seductive effort pleases from start to finish. Supple and dense, it's got strawberry, blueberry, plum and black cherry, a touch of chocolate, and that underlying streak of mineral. All these elements are in good proportion and finish with an appealing silky texture. It's delicious already, but give it another decade for full enjoyment. Drink now through 2028.
